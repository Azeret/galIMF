# GalIMF version UFD BooI

last update: 20.Jan.2020

This is a branch version of GalIMF (https://github.com/Azeret/galIMF) modified specifically for the publication: Zhiqiang Yan, Tereza Jerabkova1, and Pavel Kroupa (2020) Chemical evolution of ultra-faint dwarf galaxies in theself-consistently calculated IGIMF theory.

The modification up on GalIMF version 1.1.7 are made to follow a very similar set of assumptions applied by Lacchin et al. (2019).

The modification as follows:
1. Apply a gas-mass-dependent SFR.
2. Apply a uniform galactic wind and add the calculation of gas binding energy following Bradamante et al. (1998, their eq. 21 to 23).
3. Apply a new set of stellar yield table of massive stars and SNIa follow Lacchin et al. (2019).
4. Now the yield of massive stars are interpretated for different initial stellar metallicities.
5. The single-degenerate DTD formulation given by Matteucci and Recchi (2001, their eq. 2) is applied (optional).
