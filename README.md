## Overview

GalIMF stands for the Galaxy-wide Initial Mass Function originated from the Integrated-Galactic-IMF (IGIMF) theory [Kroupa & Weidner (2003)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2003ApJ...598.1076K/abstract).

GalIMF version 1.0 (with a companion paper [Yan, Jerabkova, Kroupa 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...607A.126Y/abstract)). It is a Python 3 module that compute galaxy-wide initial stellar mass functions based on locally derived empirical constraints following the IGIMF theory ([Weidner et al. 2013](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013MNRAS.436.3309W); [Kroupa et al. 2013](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2013pss5.book..115K)).

GalIMF version 1.1 (with a companion paper [Yan et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...629A..93Y/abstract)). It is a Python 3 module that couples the IGIMF theory with galaxy chemical evolution.


## Scientific motivation

The initial stellar mass function (IMF) can be defined as a mass distribution of stars formed during one star formation event in a region of approximately the size of 1 pc. The stellar IMF, therefore, dictates the number of supernova explosions, the chemical enrichment, how bright the stellar population and unresolved objects are and many other issues which affect directly or indirectly a vast majority of astrophysical fields.

Despite ongoing research, we still cannot formulate and predict the IMF self-consistently. Therefore it is necessary to look at the empirical evidence which might help us to understand the IMF.

One possible way of doing so is to look at Galactic star forming regions and try to estimate the shape of the IMF as is done by [Marks et al. (2012)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.422.2246M/abstract). Then we can look at whole galaxies which can have very different chemical compositions and very different densities and other physical parameters. For a galaxy, we can measure the emitted light and we can try to constrain the total mass and deduce the composite galaxy-wide IMF. For example, one could use the Hα EW and galaxy color as in [Hoversten & Glazebrook (2008)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2008ApJ...675..163H) or the ratio between Hα and UV luminosity as in [Lee et al. (2009)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2009ApJ...706..599L).

And now here comes the question:

1. If we take the locally constrained empirical laws and integrate them so we create this galaxy-wide IMF, will we get the same as the locally constrained stellar IMF? If yes, well it would be great and if not we can learn something more about the local IMF based on other galaxies. To help with exactly this problem we present this Python module GalIMF. And indeed, [Yan, Jerabkova, Kroupa (2017)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...607A.126Y/abstract) demonstrated that the observations are consistent with prediction given by the IGIMF theory.
2. Since the galaxy-wide IMF systematical vary with the galactic properties (see [Development](https://github.com/Azeret/galIMF#development) below),  the galaxy evolution history should be different from the estimates applying the canonical invariant IMF. What would be the influence of such a modification and what are the new implications? This is exactly what we are trying to answer in [Yan, Zhiqiang; Jerabkova, Tereza; Kroupa, Pavel; Vazdekis, Alejandro (2019)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...629A..93Y/abstract).


## The galaxy-wide IMF generator

The module calculating the galaxy-wide IMF is described here while more detailed comments can be found in the source code
together with the support PDF file ([supplementary-document-galimf.pdf](https://github.com/Azeret/galIMF/blob/master/supplementary-document-galimf.pdf)), where all equations are derived in detail and labeled in a consistent way with the source code [galIMF.py](https://github.com/Azeret/galIMF/blob/master/galIMF.py).

An example file, [example_galaxy.py](https://github.com/Azeret/galIMF/blob/master/example_galaxy.py), is provided for a quick test and also serve as an easy entrance for the most basic usage of [galIMF.py](https://github.com/Azeret/galIMF/blob/master/galIMF.py).

GalIMF is also able to optimally sample not an entire galaxy, but only one embedded star cluster with given mass and metallicity. This is demonstrated in [example_star_cluster.py](https://github.com/Azeret/galIMF/blob/master/example_star_cluster.py).


GalIMF represents a Python 3 module which allows computing galaxy-wide IMFs under various assumptions. With the module, we distribute an example script where we use the invariant two-part power-law canonical IMF (Kroupa 2001) as a benchmark and the grid of Salpeter slopes (2.3) drawn into the figures is used for demonstration of IMF variations.

For the computational details, please, look at [Yan, Jerabkova, Kroupa (2017)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...607A.126Y/abstract) and [Schulz, Pflamm-Altenburg & Kroupa (2015)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...582A..93S/abstract).


#### Main features of the module

The generated stellar mass distribution depends on the galaxy-wide star formation rate (**SFR**, which is related to the total mass of a galalxy) and the galaxy-wide **metallicity** ([M/H], see alpha1_model, alpha2_model, and alpha3_model in the code file [galIMF.py](https://github.com/Azeret/galIMF/blob/master/galIMF.py)).

The code can generate a galaxy-wide IMF, i.e., IGIMF. It can also generate all the stellar masses within a galaxy with optimal sampling, i.e., OSGIMF:

* IGIMF in its integrated form

Based on a local IMF (can be the fixed universal Kroupa IMF or the systematically varying IMF based on [Marks et al. 2012](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2012MNRAS.422.2246M)), GalIMF will produce the galaxy-wide IMF in a data file with contents: stellar mass [Msun] vs. IGIMF values [number of stars Msun^(-1)] normalized to the total mass of a stellar population (see [Yan, Jerabkova, Kroupa 2017](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...607A.126Y/abstract) for details).

* OSGIMF

The optimally sampled galaxy-wide IMF is based on the same local assumptions as the IGIMF above, however, it represents a discrete formulation of the IMF. That is, its output is in the form of the number of stars in mass bins. The optimal sampling methodology implemented here is from [Schulz, Pflamm-Altenburg & Kroupa (2015)](http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2015A%26A...582A..93S) which generates stars from the IMF without Poison noise (therefore "optimal sampling"). This method presents a probe which is capable of testing the nature of star formation as an alternative to random / stochastic sampling of the IMF.

* Additional functions

To compute the IGIMF or the OSGIMF, the GalIMF module contains all local IMF properties (e.g. the dependence of the stellar IMF on the metallicity, on the density of the star-cluster forming molecular cloud cores), and this software module can, therefore, be also used to obtain only the stellar IMF with various prescriptions, or to investigate other features of the stellar population such as what is the most massive star that can be formed in a star cluster.

* Features of the code: IGIMF and OSGIMF

This script needs two input values: SFR (the star formation rate, in Msun/yr) and the [M/H] value. The output is the IGIMF and OSGIMF as a function of stellar mass, normalized to the total stellar mass. The IGIMF and OSGIMF values are also written into the output file.  To demonstrate the shape of the generated IMF, we include a grid of Salpeter power-law indices into the figures.



### Deployment

For users without any experience with Python, we recommend using [Anaconda](https://www.continuum.io/) to install Python 3 and all required packages.

For users who already have installed Python 3, we recommend using [pip](https://pip.pypa.io/en/stable/) to install all required packages. An instruction can be found [here](https://www.scipy.org/install.html).

For users having both Python 2 and Python 3 installed, your two Python interpreter may coexisting with the same name. See [this page](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/341184/can-i-install-python-3-x-and-2-x-on-the-same-computer) if it causes any problem.



### Getting Started

In the following subsections, we describe how to install and set up the module. We tested this on MACOSX, Linux and Windows platforms.

#### Prerequisites

The GalIMF module is written in Python 3, therefore you need to install [Python 3](https://www.python.org/download/releases/3.0/) and the following packages:

For analyzing and visualize the results as our example script [example_galaxy.py](https://github.com/Azeret/galIMF/blob/master/example_galaxy.py) does, one needs [numpy](http://www.numpy.org/), [scipy](https://www.scipy.org/), [matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/).



#### Running the test

To learn how to use the code and to present its main features also to researchers not familiar with Python, we prepared an example implementation of the GalIMF module. This example implementation is called [example_galaxy.py](https://github.com/Azeret/galIMF/blob/master/example_galaxy.py) and is included together with the module.

First, make sure you are using Python 3, then write:
```
python directory_of_example_galaxy/example_galaxy.py
```
into a terminal to run our example program. Further instructions will show up in the terminal.

The [example_galaxy.py](https://github.com/Azeret/galIMF/blob/master/example_galaxy.py) will generate a TXT file and a PDF file in the same directory as the basic output of GalIMF.



### Employ GalIMF for your own program

#### For Python programs

You can download the GalIMF repository and call the [galIMF.py](https://github.com/Azeret/galIMF/blob/master/galIMF.py) module based on the placement in your computer.

If the Module directory is in the same directory as your own Python script (this is the case of the presented example [example_galaxy.py](https://github.com/Azeret/galIMF/blob/master/example_galaxy.py)) you will import [galIMF.py](https://github.com/Azeret/galIMF/blob/master/galIMF.py) as:
```python
import galIMF
```
If it is in a different directory, it is also possible to call it from its directory using:
```python
import directory.galIMF
```
The third option is to put [galIMF.py](https://github.com/Azeret/galIMF/blob/master/galIMF.py) into the Python directory structure so that you can easily deploy [galIMF.py](https://github.com/Azeret/galIMF/blob/master/galIMF.py) for your Python 3 project in any directory all as:
```python
import galIMF
```

To do that open Python interpreter and run:
```python
import sys
sys.path
```
This will locate Python libraries on your computer (usually there is something similar to "...\lib\site-packages"). If GalIMF is placed in this directory the [galIMF.py](https://github.com/Azeret/galIMF/blob/master/galIMF.py) module can be called from the Python script located anywhere simply as:
```python
import galIMF
```
Then you can treat GalIMF as the same as any other packages.

#### For non-Python programs

Use a pipeline to first run, e.g., the [example_galaxy.py](https://github.com/Azeret/galIMF/blob/master/example_galaxy.py). Then read in the output files of GalIMF, e.g., GalIMF_IGIMF.txt, for your own program.



### Inputs/parameters

#### Basic inputs

To apply the IGIMF theory on different galaxies, the following parameters should be changed. They are also the required input of our example code [example_galaxy.py](https://github.com/Azeret/galIMF/blob/master/example_galaxy.py):

* galaxy-wide star formation rate: SFR

* galaxy-wide metallicity [M/H]: M_over_H

* OSGIMF stellar mass resolution: resolution


#### Other adjustable parameters

The following inputs are not essential for the IGIMF theory and can be changed according to the research context:

* Resolution parameter

bindw: defined in [example_galaxy.py](https://github.com/Azeret/galIMF/blob/master/example_galaxy.py),
will automatically change the resolution of histograms for optimal sampling.

M_turn2 = 1:
second mass at which the power-law index of the stellar IMF changes [Solar mass] (i.e. in the canonical IMF, the IMF power-law index changes from alpha_2=2.3 to alpha_3=2.3 at a stellar mass of 1.0 Msun, i.e., the canonical IMF has a Salpeter index above 0.5 Msun)

#### Internal parameters of the theory

The following parameters should not be changed as they are part of the IGIMF theory. Read [Yan, Jerabkova, Kroupa (2017)](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2017A%26A...607A.126Y/abstract) carefully if you do intend to change them.

## The galaxy evolution module

### Main features

A galaxy evolution model is developed (See [Yan et al. 2019](https://ui.adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/2019A%26A...629A..93Y/abstract) for a detailed description of the model) that can couple the IGIMF theory or any other variable IMF theory.

The current code is designed for the monolithic collapse galaxy formation scenario, that particularly applies to the central regions of giant ellipticals, thus assumes no gas infall.

The with this model, it is possible to vary the galaxy-wide IMF at each time step depending on the galaxy-wide star formation rate and the gas-phase metallicity at the time.

In order to compare different IMF assumption with the same condition, the star formation history of a galaxy can be specified and fixed.

The deployment of this module is already covered when deploying the galaxy-wide IMF generator.

Setup the parameters for the main function of galevo.py, run it to start a galaxy chemical evolution simulation. The output will be in saved .txt files and generated plots.

### Inputs

The main inputs are:
1. SFH: The star formation history (SFH) of a simulation need to be specified in the file "SFH.txt", if SFH_model='provided', where the number in each line of the "SFH.txt" stands for the star formation rate (solar mass per year) at time t (t = line number * 10 Myr). The SFH.txt can be automatically generated by the function "generate_SFH" where the shape of the SFH, e.g., flat or lognorm; peak star formation rate (Log_SFR), and star formation duration (SFEN) need to be set up.
2. IMF assumption: Can be the IGIMF (imf='igimf'), Kroupa-IMF, Salpeter-IMF or other given IMF defined in the folder "IMFs".
3. STF: Star transformation fraction (STF) determines the initial gas mass. Higher mass of star formation (specified in the file "SFH.txt") and higher STF both leads to higher initial gas mass.

Other (currently activate) input parameters include the settings of initial gas metallicity (Z_0), solar abundance mass fraction, i.e., X, Y, and Z (solar_mass_component), stellar yield table (str_yield_table), possible mass of the most massive star (steller_mass_upper_bound), efficiency of the star formation (SFE, only activate when SFH_model='gas_mass_dependent'), type Ia supernova yield table (SNIa_yield_table), solar abundance table (solar_abu_table).
And the flags include whether to activate type Ia supernova (SNIa_ON), insert more time step (high_time_resolution), show the plots (plot_show), save the plots (plot_save), activate galactic wind (outflow), and use previously generated gwIMF (check_igimf).

### Example

An example is given in file "example_galaxy_evolution.py", which calls "galevo.py", goes through the set up of the main input parameters, and shows the resulting plots.



## Additional information

### Versioning

This site always keep the newest GalIMF version and the old version used in our publications.

We use [SemVer](http://semver.org/) for versioning. That is,

1. the first digits stand for MAJOR update that is incompatible with the earlier version;
2. the second digits indicate MINOR update when new features or function is added in a backwards-compatible manner;
3. the last digits note the backwards-compatible error corrections (e.g., adding comments, change parameter names, etc.).

See the [GalIMF homepage](https://sites.google.com/view/galimf/home) for an overlook of all the major versions, related scientific publications, and simulations demonstrations.



### Updates

The major updates include:
1. Add example files that demonstrates how to construct star cluster and galaxy-wide IMF as well as getting each stellar mass in the star cluster or the galaxy applying the IGIMF theory with the galIMF.py model.
2. Change the IMF metal dependence parameter from the iron abundance, [Fe/H], to the total metallicity, [M/H], indicating that the IMF variation depend on general or total metallicity instead of solely on the iron abundance. The old version applying [Fe/H] follows the formulation in Marks et al. 2012 (MNRAS.422.2246M) correctly but the author of this paper (through private communication) actually consider the [Fe/H] to be a representative of [M/H]. It makes more sense that all metal element should have a similar effect (if not an identical effect) to the IMF variation.
3. Some function names in the file galIMF.py are changed to lower case letters. This may cause incompatible issues. Please change the function names accordingly or use the galIMF_version_1.0.py instead of galIMF.py.
4. Add the galaxy evolution model, galaxy_evol.py, and corresponding supporting data files. The new model adopt the galaxy-wide IMF for a single 10 Myr star formation epoch calculated by galIMF.py to the galaxy formation and evolution in a 10 Gyr timescale. (01.01.2019)
5. The approximated stellar luminosity weighted results is now available. The "stellar luminosity" adopted are the luminosity of the star during its main-sequence stage and do not consider any stellar evolution, i.e., the luminosity is only a function the stellar initial mass but not its age or metallicity. (10.02.2019)
6. An uniform outflow (uniform in the sense that the element ratios are the same as the well-mixed gas phase) that is proportional to the stellar mass formed is added. It has a minor effect on the final total gas mass (roughly 0.3 dex) and the metal abundances (roughly 0.1 dex) and a negligible effect on the galaxy final metal abundance ratios (roughly 0.05 dex).
7. The calculation of ejected gas mass has been corrected from "ejected_gas_mass_of_this_epoch = M_tot_of_this_epoch - stellar_mass_of_a_epoch_at_a_time_step - remnant_mass_of_this_epoch" to "ejected_gas_mass_of_this_epoch = H_mass_of_this_epoch + He_mass_of_this_epoch + metal_mass_of_this_epoch". The previous equation was wrong since the remnant_mass_of_this_epoch is a spline fitted value of the stellar yield table instead of the original value given by the yield table. (for version 1.1.6 on 17 Sep 2019)
